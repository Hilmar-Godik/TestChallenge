# How to contribute
The best way to contribute is to Fork this project and add more challenges. 
I suggest that you add a new codeunit. The next in line. Test Challenge 02 for example. 
Put both your tests and the functions into the same codeunit. Just to make it simpler. 
Then make a Pull Request to get them added to the project.
